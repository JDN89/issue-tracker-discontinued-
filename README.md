# issue-tracker

Github wa not showing my commits in my atctivity graph.
The only solution I had was cloning this repository into another repo and continue from there

- this repo is now deprecated
- I will continue in dotnet-vue-issue-tracker

- Work in progress
- currently building out the frontend
