# issue-tracker

Github wa not showing my commits in my atctivity graph.
I think because I created my repo directly from VScode instead of initializing it first from the CLI
The only solution I had was cloning this repository into another repo and continue from there

- this repo is now deprecated
- I will continue in dotnet-vue-issue-tracker https://github.com/JDN89/vue-dotnet-issue-tracker
